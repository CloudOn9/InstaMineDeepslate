## 1.18 made it harder to clear large amounts of space by mining. Let us alleviate that pain a little.

###### Usage
You will instantly mine Deepslate, so long as you are using an efficiency 5 Netherite pickaxe, and have haste II. This is similar to how mining stone with an efficiency 5 Diamond pickaxe with haste II is instant.  
This will not affect other deepslate block variants, or the speed of mining deepslate when the above conditions are not met.

##### Commands
This plugin only has one command - `/instaminedeepslate [enable/disable]`. To save your fingers from typing as much, you can use `/imd [enable/disable]` instead.

##### Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  instaminedeepslate.changespeed:
    description: "Change if deepslate can be broken immediately, given the right conditions."
    default: op
  instaminedeepslate.eligible:
    description: "If someone is eligible to instantly break deepslate, given the right\
      \ conditions."
    default: "true"
  instaminedeepslate.updater:
    description: "If someone is allowed to see when the plugin has updates"
    default: op
```
